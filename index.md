I am Borgmon. A indie game dev. I make VR game as well as mobile games. Unity is what I good at, but I'm a quick learner, and accept any challenge. I love make music. I make synth for my games. Maybe I will open a soundcloud someday. As for web, I know how to develop front end application (angular.js). You can know more through my work. Open for any collaboration.
